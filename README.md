# A BUTTON YOU SHOULD NOT PRESS

A single-page “experience” with one button that slowly becomes… less cooperative.
It remembers your presses (localStorage), changes mood, and starts pushing back.

## Demo
Open `index.html` (GitHub Pages recommended).

## Notes
- No dependencies.
- One file.
- The UI intentionally degrades (a little).
